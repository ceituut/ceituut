## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Send pull request

3. Send pull request.

## Report bugs using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/codegeeks-ir/codegeeks-ir/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!
